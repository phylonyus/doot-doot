## Installation

### Prerequisites:
  * Python 3.7
  * Discord.py rewrite library
  * Discord bot account with token (obtainable through the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/))
  * aiohttp library
  
### Starting bot:
  1. Install pre-requisites
  2. Copy bot files to location where you want to store them
  3. Replace 'token' in main.py with token
  4. Open CMD/PowerShell/Terminal and navigate to folder with bot files
  5. Type ``python main.py`` (if it will not work try ``python3.7 main.py``
  6. Wait until bot logs in to Discord
  
  
## Adding new sound effects
  1. Add the bot to your server
  2. Drag a mp3 or wav file onto Discord (`wow1.mp3` will become the command `'wow1`)
  3. In the upload dialog, add  `'add`
  4. (Optional) Add the sound effect to category (`'add wow` will make the command `wow wow1`)
  
  note: calling a category will play a random sound from that category
